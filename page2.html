		<p> The goal of this project was to recreate the classic pong game from 1972. In my game their are 2 paddles and 1 ball 
		that the players take turns hitting back and forth. The ball bounces bounces off the top or bottom of the wall and then
		the paddle. if the player misses then the other player scores the point. if you wish to replay the game after you played it you need 
		to reclick the link Pong Game and it will reset the game.
